  Coach here. Today we will begin to build a universe in our minds. It is a wonderful universe. No quantum physics or relativity exists here. That makes it easier to imagine. Don't be fooled though, this universe can also get very complicated. Most engineers spend their entire careers dreaming about this universe. It took people hundreds of years to plumb the depths of this universe, and we still don't know everything about it. The universe that I, Coach Big Mack, want you to imagine is called the Newtonian universe.  

  "Why," you ask, "must I imagine this Newtonian universe? I want to learn about our universe, Big Mack!"

  First of all, call me Coach. Second of all, good reader, you really do not want to learn about our universe right now. Trust Coach on this one. Our universe is waaaaay beyond understanding, even for the brighest minds in modern physics - even for Coach. Besides, the Newtonian universe usually does the same things as our own universe. That's why it is so nice and useful to imagine the Newtonian universe. It is simpler, but it still helps us understand our own in most cases. The Newtonian universe is what we call a model - not exactly the same as real life but close enough.

  That's enough talk about models. Let's start building this Newtonian universe. We will start with one dimension of space. Don't ask me what a dimension is. I don't know. Just picture it. It's probably something like this.
