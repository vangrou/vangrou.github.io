Coach here. Today we will begin to build a universe in our minds. It is a wonderful universe. No quantum physics or relativity exists here. That makes it easier to imagine.

It took people hundreds of years to plumb the depths of this universe, and we still don't know everything about it. The universe that I, Coach Big Mack, want you to imagine is called the Newtonian Universe.
