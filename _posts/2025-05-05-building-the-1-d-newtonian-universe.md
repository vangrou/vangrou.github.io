  Coach here. Today we will begin to build a universe in our minds. It is a wonderful universe. No quantum physics or relativity exists here. That makes it easier to imagine. Don't be fooled though, this universe can also get very complicated. Most engineers spend their entire careers dreaming about this universe. It took people hundreds of years to plumb the depths of this universe, and we still don't know everything about it. The universe that I, Coach Big Mack, want you to imagine is called the Newtonian universe.  

  "Why," you ask, "must I imagine this Newtonian universe? I want to learn about our universe, Big Mack!"

  First of all, call me Coach. Second of all, good reader, you really do not want to learn about our universe right now. Trust Coach on this one. Our universe is waaaaay beyond understanding, even for the brighest minds in modern physics - even for Coach. Besides, the Newtonian universe usually does the same things as our own universe. That's why it is so nice and useful to imagine the Newtonian universe. It is simpler, but it still helps us understand our own in most cases. The Newtonian universe is what we call a model - not exactly the same as real life but close enough.

  That's enough talk about models. Let's start building this Newtonian universe. We will start with one dimension of space. Don't ask me what a dimension is. I don't know. Just picture it. It's probably something like this.

That's what we call space. We're just starting with 1-D space. It might look pretty boring, and it is. Space in the Newtonian universe doesn't do much. It's just there. Now let's add a particle to this 1-D space. A particle is pretty much just a very small thing in space. Don't worry about its mass or charge or anything like that. Just put it in space.

Now we're talking! Some action! Hold on just a second though. If you keep staring at the picture above, nothing seems to happen. Perhaps the particle is doing something, but we can't tell. We're stuck. We have nothing to say about this Newtonian universe.

It is at this time that I, Coach Big Mack, will go Noah Webster mode (great guy that Noah Webster). Noah Webster defined words, which is good.
