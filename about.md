Hey there. I go by many names - The Wizard, Two Fist Charlie, Eddie Fast Fingers. You can call me Coach Big Mack. If you want to learn about physics, you've come to the right place. Physics can be hard. If it's not, you are probably skipping the hard parts. In this blog, Coach will try to make things as easy as possible.
